explain what integrable singularity is, use simple example of x/root(x)
using equatoin to find probabliity that sum momentum of particles in JET will be below certain threshhold
take some observable of the particles observed in JET stream, Fcx indicates the geometry of the JET
this equation takes Fcx and gives the probability they're all below a certain number which indicates the gemotry
threshhold has no units as Fcx is a ratio, look at paper
explain what JET of particles is (hightly coordinates bunch of hadrons)
equation acts as a filter for certain gemoetries so you can find the probality of how many events will be a certain type
kinda like an efficiency
the equatoins I'm working with are part of the main equation overall, though the main equation is analytic mine are not due to singularities
be very direct with going through what part I'm relatd to (I have this expression, it has this integral, it has this singularity)
can compare agianst naieve integration without change of variable
